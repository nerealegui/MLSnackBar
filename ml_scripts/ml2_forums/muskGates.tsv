elonmusk	253k as of 7am this morning
elonmusk	@asunshinegreene yes
elonmusk	Mars requires developing complex technology over a decade+, but market cares about next 3 months. Result would be conflicting priorities.
elonmusk	Next landing attempt will be 3rd launch from now. Tonight's flight and following one will not have enough propellant.
elonmusk	Would also like to congratulate @Boeing, fellow winner of the @NASA commercial crew program
elonmusk	While the rocket does look rather tall &amp; tippy, a stable landing is no problem with proper throttle response https://t.co/B4Y6D4dpsc
elonmusk	@RichardGarriott Just the air in Dragon. Technically, if a few humans had stowed aboard Dragon on the last flight, they would've been ok.
elonmusk	Cause of hard rocket landing confirmed as due to slower than expected throttle valve response. Next attempt in 2 months.
elonmusk	@dfjsteve Very similar. The crush core in the Falcon legs is reusable after soft landings, but needs to be replaced after hard.

elonmusk	@ID_AA_Carmack No choice. Entry velocity too high for a precision landing with N2 thrusters alone. Must have aero surfaces for pitch trim.

Highest so far, but velocity matters much more"
elonmusk	@MichaelEMann I'm just saying that we should see what happens first. The actions may be surprising.

elonmusk	Rumors about canceling Falcon wing doors are false. At Tesla, the production car will always be better than the show car.
elonmusk	@tjeviston @business exactly
elonmusk	@AdamMKE Model S can seat 5 adults, two kids and has a front trunk for luggage. Might work for you.
elonmusk	It's starting to feel kinda normal to reuse rockets. Good. That's how it is for cars &amp; airplanes and how it should be for rockets.

elonmusk	@margotroosevelt Only heard about this today. Sounds like the wrong thing happened on many levels. Will investigate and make it right.
elonmusk	Would also like to correct expectations that Tesla/SolarCity will need to raise equity or corp debt in Q4. Won't be necessary for either.

elonmusk	Battery pack swap works with all Tesla Model S cars, past and present. It was always there.
elonmusk	@MrBoylan Duplicates will be cancelled. Max of 2 will be delivered to any one person. Only ~5% of orders are 2, so speculation unlikely.

elonmusk	@UKPJD Similar to SpaceX, the T is like a cross section of an electric motor, just as the X is like a rocket trajectory

elonmusk	@rocketrepreneur Meant to say 200 AR for production vac engine. Dev will be up to 150. Beyond that, too much flow separation in Earth atmos.
